# clevolution

This is an attempt to implement some of the work described in Karl Sims' 1991 SIGGRAPH paper
[Artificial Evolution for Computer Graphics](http://www.karlsims.com/papers/siggraph91.html).
It is also my vehicle for learning Clojure. The code evolves along with my understanding of functional programming.

Sample usage code is in a comment in [core.clj](https://github.com/nodename/clevolution/blob/master/src/clevolution/core.clj).
 
For more details please see the intro to the original haXe version of Evolution: http://nodename.github.com/
